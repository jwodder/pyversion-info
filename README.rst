Ever needed to know what Python versions were currently supported, or how many
subversions a given Python version had?  Wondering how long until a given
version came out or reached end-of-life?  The answers to these and some other
questions can be found with this library.

``pyversion-info`` pulls its data every run from
`jwodder/pyversion-info-data <https://github.com/jwodder/pyversion-info-data>`_
on GitHub.  Prerelease versions are not (currently) included.  I promise
24-hour turnaround times for keeping the database up-to-date until I am hit by
a bus.


Installation
============
``pyversion-info`` requires Python 3.6 or higher.  Just use `pip
<https://pip.pypa.io>`_ for Python 3 (You have pip, right?) to install
``pyversion-info`` and its dependencies::

    python3 -m pip install pyversion-info


Examples
========

Start out by fetching the database:

>>> from pyversion_info import get_pyversion_info
>>> pyvinfo = get_pyversion_info()

Get a list of all currently-supported Python series:

>>> pyvinfo.supported_series()
['2.7', '3.5', '3.6', '3.7']

When does 3.8 come out?

>>> pyvinfo.release_date("3.8")
datetime.date(2019, 10, 21)

When does 2.7 reach end-of-life?

>>> pyvinfo.eol_date("2.7")
datetime.date(2020, 1, 1)

Just how many micro versions does 2.7 have, anyway?

>>> pyvinfo.subversions("2.7")
['2.7.0', '2.7.1', '2.7.2', '2.7.3', '2.7.4', '2.7.5', '2.7.6', '2.7.7', '2.7.8', '2.7.9', '2.7.10', '2.7.11', '2.7.12', '2.7.13', '2.7.14', '2.7.15', '2.7.16']

How many versions of Python 3 have been released?

>>> pyvinfo.subversions("3")
['3.0', '3.1', '3.2', '3.3', '3.4', '3.5', '3.6', '3.7']


API
===

Versions are passed to & returned from methods as strings in the form ``"X"``
(a major version), ``"X.Y"`` (a minor version), or ``"X.Y.Z"`` (a micro
version).

All dates are returned as ``datetime.date`` objects.

``PyVersionInfo``
-----------------
A class for querying Python versions and their release & EOL dates

``PyVersionInfo(data: dict)``
   Construct a new ``PyVersionInfo`` object from a `dict` containing version
   release dates and series EOL dates structured in accordance with `this
   JSON Schema`__

   __ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwodder/pyversion-info-data/master/
      pyversion-info-data.schema.json

``pyvinfo.eol_date(series: str) -> Union[date, None, Literal[True]]``
   Returns the end-of-life date of the given Python version series (i.e., a
   minor version like 3.5).  The return value may be ``None``, indicating that
   the series is not yet end-of-life and its end-of-life date is unknown or
   undetermined.  The return value may alternatively be ``True``, indicating
   that the series has reached end-of-life but the date on which that happened
   is unknown.

``pyvinfo.is_eol(series: str) -> bool``
   Returns whether the given version series has reached end-of-life yet

``pyvinfo.is_released(version: str) -> bool``
   Returns whether the given version has been released yet.  For a major or
   minor version, this is the whether the first (in version order) micro
   version has been released.

``pyvinfo.is_supported(version: str) -> bool``
   Returns whether the given version is currently supported.  For a micro
   version, this is whether it has been released and the corresponding minor
   version is not yet end-of-life.  For a major or minor version, this is
   whether at least one subversion is supported.

``pyvinfo.major_versions(unreleased: bool = False) -> List[str]``
   Returns a list in version order of all Python major versions (as strings).
   If ``unreleased`` is true (default: ``False``), the list includes unreleased
   versions; otherwise, they are omitted.

``pyinfo.micro_versions(unreleased: bool = False) -> List[str]``
   Returns a list in version order of all Python micro versions Versions in the
   form ``X.Y`` are included here as ``X.Y.0``.

   If ``unreleased`` is true (default: ``False``), the list includes unreleased
   versions; otherwise, they are omitted.

``pyvinfo.minor_versions(unreleased: bool = False) -> List[str]``
   Returns a list in version order of all Python minor versions.  If
   ``unreleased`` is true (default: ``False``), the list includes unreleased
   versions; otherwise, they are omitted.

``pyvinfo.release_date(version: str) -> Optional[date]``
   Returns the release date of the given Python version.  For a major or minor
   version, this is the release date of its first (in version order) micro
   version.  The return value may be ``None``, indicating that, though the
   version has been released and is known to the database, its release date is
   unknown.

``pyvinfo.subversions(version: str, unreleased: bool = False) -> List[str]``
   Returns a list in version order of all subversions of the given version.  If
   ``version`` is a major version, this is all of its released minor versions.
   If ``version`` is a minor version, this is all of its released micro
   versions.

   If ``unreleased`` is true (default: ``False``), the list includes unreleased
   subversions.  Otherwise, they are omitted.

``pyvinfo.supported_series() -> List[str]``
   Returns a list in version order of all Python version series (i.e., minor
   versions like 3.5) that are currently supported (i.e., that have at least
   one release made and are not yet end-of-life)


Utilities
---------

``UnknownVersionError``
   Subclass of ``ValueError`` raised when ``PyVersionInfo`` is asked for
   information about a version that does not appear in its database.
   Operations that result in an ``UnknownVersionError`` may succeed later as
   more Python versions are announced & released.

   The unknown version is stored in an ``UnknownVersionError`` instance's
   ``version`` attribute.

``get_pyversion_info(url: str = pyversion_info.DATA_URL, cache_dir: Optional[str] = pyversion_info.CACHE_DIR) -> PyVersionInfo``
    Fetches the latest version release data from ``url`` and returns a new
    ``PyVersionInfo`` object.  The HTTP response is cached in ``cache_dir`` to
    speed up future requests (or ``cache_dir`` can be set to ``None`` to
    disable caching).


Command
=======

*New in version 0.4.0*

``pyversion-info`` also provides a command of the same name for querying
information about Python versions from the command line::

    pyversion-info [<global-options>] <command> [<args> ...]

Currently, ``pyversion-info`` has two subcommands, ``list`` and ``show``.


Global Options
--------------

-d DATABASE, --database DATABASE
                                Use the given JSON file as the version
                                information database instead of fetching data
                                from the default URL.  ``DATABASE`` can be
                                either an HTTP or HTTPS URL or a path to a
                                local file.


``pyversion-info list``
-----------------------

::

    pyversion-info [<global-options>] list [<options>] {major|minor|micro}

List all major, minor, or micro Python versions, one per line.


Options
^^^^^^^

-a, --all                       List all known versions of the given level
-n, --not-eol                   Only list versions that have not yet reached
                                end-of-life (i.e., all supported versions plus
                                all unreleased versions)
-r, --released                  Only list released versions.  This is the
                                default.
-s, --supported                 Only list currently-supported versions


``pyversion-info show``
-----------------------

::

    pyversion-info [<global-options>] show [<options>] <version>

Show various information about a given Python version.

For a major version, the output is of the form::

    Version: 3
    Level: major
    Release-date: 2008-12-03
    Is-released: yes
    Is-supported: yes
    Subversions: 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9

For a minor version, the output is of the form::

    Version: 3.3
    Level: minor
    Release-date: 2012-09-29
    Is-released: yes
    Is-supported: no
    EOL-date: 2017-09-29
    Is-EOL: yes
    Subversions: 3.3.0, 3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 3.3.5, 3.3.6, 3.3.7

For a micro version, the output is of the form::

    Version: 3.9.5
    Level: micro
    Release-date: 2021-05-03
    Is-released: yes
    Is-supported: yes


Options
^^^^^^^

-J, --json                      Output JSON

-S, --subversions <all|not-eol|released|supported>
                                Which subversions to list; the choices have the
                                same meanings as the ``list`` options of the
                                same name  [default: released]


Caveats
=======

The database is generally only updated when an edit is made to a release
schedule PEP.  Occasionally, a deadline listed in a PEP is missed, but the PEP
is not updated for a couple days, and so for a brief period this library will
falsely report the given version as released.
