List released Python versions and their release & EOL dates

Ever needed to know what Python versions were currently supported, or how many
subversions a given Python version had?  Wondering how long until a given
version came out or reached end-of-life?  The answers to these and some other
questions can be found with this library.

``pyversion-info`` pulls its data every run from
`jwodder/pyversion-info-data <https://github.com/jwodder/pyversion-info-data>`_
on GitHub.  Prerelease versions are not (currently) included.  I promise
24-hour turnaround times for keeping the database up-to-date until I am hit by
a bus.
